# EDA-for-Netflix-Data-Using-Python

Continuing my learning journey and satisfying my curiosity to know more about Data. I did a Basic EDA on Netflix Data this time â€¦.using Python(I was really anxious initially to use python on my own without much guidance, but we all have to start from somewhere right :).

So what I did

ðŸ‘‰ Prepared me, with a basic certification in python.

ðŸ‘‰ Some useful youtube link

[Programming with Mosh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)

ðŸ‘‰Did a few exercises on Hackerrank.

So that was my Warmup. Letâ€™s move to the Workout Session now

ðŸ‘‰Downloaded the Netflix Data Set

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019.

ðŸ‘‰[Here is my Basic EDA](https://github.com/korharleen/EDA-for-Netflix-Data-Using-Python/blob/main/EDA%20for%20Netflix%20Data.ipynb)

I learned about how vast the usage of python is. Its inbuilt libraries make it one of the most powerful tools available for data analysis.
